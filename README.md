## Testing
Throughout the entire process, I utilized the Chrome Developer Tools to verify the site's:
  - Responsiveness on different screen sizes and mobile devices
    - When there was unexpected behavior when shriking the screen size, I knew at which screen size I needed to add a media query.
  - Lighthouse was used to rate the site's accessibility and efficiency.

## Validator Testing
#### HTML
- No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.
#### CSS
- No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.
